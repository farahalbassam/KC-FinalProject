   <h4 style="font-size: 60px;"> - How To Cook</h4>  

    <ul style="background-color: rgb(249, 251, 245); width: 1000px;">
        <li>1. Prepare the enchilada sauce:
            (if making homemade, otherwise use canned and skip to the next step). Heat the oil in a sauce pan on medium high heat.
            
            Stir in the chili powder and cayenne. Let cook only for half a minute (if longer the chili will burn), and add the water and tomato paste. Whisk until smooth.
            
            Add the garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, oregano, salt, and cornstarch slurry. Let come to a simmer and remove from heat.
            
            Taste for heat. If you want it spicier, add more chili powder or cayenne. Note that the tortillas and chicken will absorb some of the heat, so allow for that and let it be a little bit spicier than what you want in the finished dish.</li>

        <li>2. Mix in 1/4 cup of the sauce with the cooked chicken:
            Set aside.</li>

        <li>3. Prepare the tortillas:
            Traditionally, one would dip the tortillas in some sauce and then lightly fry them in a little oil, and then roll them up. It's a great way to infuse the tortillas with the chili sauce, but it's really messy and many tortillas are not sturdy enough to handle this treatment without falling apart.
            
            So, instead, we soften the corn tortillas first, and then dip them in the sauce before rolling them. To soften them, and give them a little flavor from browning, I'll show you my mother's method for cooking the tortillas without using a lot of fat.
            
            Heat a tablespoon of oil in a small saucepan to coat the pan. Place a tortilla in the skillet and heat for a few seconds, until the tortilla begin to show some air bubbles.</li>

        <li>4. Assemble the enchiladas:
            Preheat the oven to 350°F. One by one, dip a tortilla in the enchilada sauce and place in a 9x13 Pyrex baking dish.
            
            Place 2 to 3 tablespoons of chopped chicken in each tortilla. Sprinkle with a little cheese.</li>

        <li>5. Bake:
            Place in the oven and bake at 350°F for 10 minutes, or until cheese is bubbly.
            
            Use a metal spatula to serve.</li>
